# Lab_1 Tasks

1. ### Parse the string

The program defines an array:

```c
char text[] = "How many and which of the vowels will you find in this sentence ?";
```

Using the switch and while instructions, write a program that will output to the screen:

1) how many times each of the vowels (aeiouy).
2) the total number of occurrences of all vowels.
3) count how many words are in the sentence.

`Attention!` Limit the number of variables to an absolute minimum, use arrays everywhere where possible.

2. ### Pointers

3. ### Sorting

1) Write a function that returns a random value from the specified range A, B. In the main() function, fill the array
   with random values from the specified range.
2) Write a function that returns the sum of n elements of an array of t[n] numbers floating point, the minimum and
   maximum value, the average value of its elements, maximum and minimum deviation from the mean value.

The function header can have one of the following characters:

```c

float sum (float t[], int n, ????) or float sum (float *t, int n, ?????)

```

3) Write a function to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The function is intended to use the algorithm of
   sorting by simple substitution (bubble sorting).

`Attention!`
In (b) and (c), write two versions of the function, first using only the indices of the elements array, and then using
pointer notation wherever possible.
