### Remove the longest static chain

#### Task:

The next (at least two) elements of a cyclic list with identical values of the Val field are called a static sublist.
Write a function that removes the longest static sublist from the cyclic list. The condition for its removal is the
existence in the leaf of exactly one of the longest static sublists. Pass a pointer to a list item to the function. The
function should return the number of deleted items.
