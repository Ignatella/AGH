### Slice the number

#### Task:

Please write a function that answers whether it is possible to "cut" a natural number into one-or two-digit parts so
that the sum of the numbers created in this way is 100. For example, for the number 225766, the answer is yes because
2+25+7+66=100, and for the number 248163, the answer is no. The function must pass the number to be examined number, and
the function must return the value true or false.
