# Before Lab_4 Tasks

1. ### LIFO

    Please implement table-based LIFO queue (stack)
    with the size specified before the #define directive.
    Stack height is stored in global variable.
      
    Define functions: 
    - Reading stack from oldest 
    ```C
    void show (int *);
    ```
    - Add to stack 
    ```C
    void push (int *, int);
    ```      
    - collecting from the
    ```C
    int pop (int *);
    ```
   
2. ### LIFO (1)

   Please implement previous task without using 
   global variables.

3. ### Sort array based on even and odd values

   Please write and test a function that turns the order 
   of the array elements into such that even elements are
   in the first part of the array, and the elements odd in
   the other. The task must be performed in place, that is,
   without the use of additional array.
    
4. ### Index, Address, Value of the biggest even number in multiple arrays
   
   Write the function ....... where (....., .....);, 
   which returns a pointer to the largest even element
   in the array. In the main () function, create three
   integer arrays of length 5, 11 and 15 elements 
   respectively. Please fill these tables with random 
   numbers from range <-10, 10>. Using the where function,
   specify index, array num, address, value of the biggest
   even number. In the main() function, implement table
   access in pointer notation.
