# Lab_2 Tasks

1. ### Triangles

    Write a program that reads a number from the
    keyboard, and then displays two triangles on 
    the screen according to the following scheme.
    
    Example of program operation for digit 5:
    ```
        54321 0    
       5432 10
      543 210
     54 3210
    5 43210
    543210
    ```
   
2. ### Dividers

    Write a program that reads an integer scanf("%d",&n); and checks 
    if it is the first number(a message should be sent).
    If the number is not the first-please write out all its dividers.

3. ### Char Triangle
    Please write a program that will load a capital letter and write a
    triangle for it according to the given example:
    
    Example of program operation for letter F:
    
    ```
     ABCDEFEDCBA
      ABCDEDCBA
       ABCDCBA
        ABCBA
         ABA
          A
    ```
    
4. ### Harmonic series sum
    Write a program that calculates the sum of the harmonic series
    with a given accuracy of 0 < eps < 1. Eps accuracy should be read
    from the keyboard.

    Tips:

    - If eps <= 0 or eps >= 1, an error message should be displayed.
    - The summation should be stopped when the next calculated 
        expression of the series is less than the eps.
