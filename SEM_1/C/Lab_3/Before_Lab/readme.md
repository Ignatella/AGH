# Before Lab_3 Tasks

1. ### The addition of large numbers

    Please implement the operation of adding long e.g.
    80-digit numbers.
   
2. ### Binary -> Decimal

    Please write a conversion function that converts the 
    character string representing binary notation for a
    number. Should I use the operator ? :

3. ### Integer -> Binary
    Please write a program that will print on the screen 
    a binary representation of the loaded an integer.
    Use bitwise operations. Use the 9-character array
    for writing. Verify that the number you are reading 
    can be written to 8 bits. The program is supposed to
    load a number and write its conversion (as a string of characters).
    
    ```c
    char number[9];
    number[8] = '\0';
    ```
    
4. ### Cut bits from number
    Please write a function that returns n bits from the number
    from the position p. The bits are numbered from the youngest.
    
5. ### Num of bits that equals 1
    Please write a function that will count the number of bits set
    to 1 in the given number.
