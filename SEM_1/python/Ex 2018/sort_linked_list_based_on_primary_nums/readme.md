A cyclic list containing natural numbers is given. Write a function that transforms a cyclic list into a simple list, so
that in the transformed list, the first numbers are at the beginning of the list and the complex numbers are at the end
of the list. The function should pass a pointer to the cyclic list, the function should return the pointer to the
resulting list
