## Divisors on two knight jumps distance

A natural number is called a triple if it is the product of three prime numbers, e.g.

> `12=2*2*3`, `42=2*3*7`

```C
int tab[n][n]
```

An array filled with natural numbers is given. Write a function that checks whether there are two elements in the array
that are two chess knights moves away from each other, the product of which is a triple. An array must be passed to the
function, the function must return `True` if such numbers are presented in the array, and `False` otherwise.
