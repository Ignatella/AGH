### Divide linked list into two based on the number of binary units

A cyclic list containing natural numbers is given. Write a function
that converts a cyclic list into two cyclic lists. The first list should
contain even numbers with an even number of ones in the binary notation,
the second list should contain odd numbers with an odd number of ones in 
the binary notation, and the remaining items should be deleted from memory.
The function should pass a pointer to the cyclic list and two pointers to
the resulting lists, the function should return the number of deleted items.
