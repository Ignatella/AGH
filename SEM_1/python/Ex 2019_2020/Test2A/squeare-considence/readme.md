###TASK:

Two numbers are five-pointed if they have the same number
of even digits in their representations in the system
positional with a base of 5. The data are two INT arrays
tab1[MAX1][MAX1], tab2[Max2][Max2] (Max2 > MAX1 > 1).
Please write a function that will test whether it is
possible to fit tab1 to tab2 so that in the overlapping
at least 33% of the corresponding items from tab1 and tab2
were 5-compliant. Note: consider that tab1 can only 
partially cover tab2 (see figure), and in the checked area 
must find get at least one item.
