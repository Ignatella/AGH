## Single Responsibility Principle

```text
Every class or method in your program should have only a single reason to change.
```

### Implementation notes:

HMM, The C# range is defined as follows:

```c#
public static System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> Range (int start, int count);
```

A very non-obvious solution :thinking:

P.S. It was much easier to implement the solution in Scala
