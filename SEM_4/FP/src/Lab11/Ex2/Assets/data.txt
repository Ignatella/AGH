 chopped fine. Simmer until the onion is cooked, season
 with salt and put in the meat-eggs and boil gently
 an hour. Lift them out carefully to a hot platter,
 thicken the sauce with a little flour, and pour over.


                   CAMOTE Y PIÑA

                       DULCE

 Pick the stems from each raisin and wash in boiling
 red wine; then put them in an infusion of cognac,
 Marsala wine and slices of fresh lemon for three
 days. Remove and heap them in bunches about the size
 of large goose-eggs and wrap each bunch in large fig
 leaves, layer upon layer, and bake for a half-hour in
 a light oven. When serving turn the leaves back and
 send to the table hot.


                     MANTECADO

 next, a layer of peeled sliced oranges, then sliced
 bananas and then a few thin slices of lemon. Sift a
 most generous supply of sugar between each layer.
 Repeat the layers until the dish is full and cover the
 top layer with chopped nuts. Lay over the top narrow
 strips of the pastry and bake slowly for an hour or
 more.


                    ENCHILADAS

 Enchiladas are made of tortillas sprinkled with
 cheese, onion, olives, etc. They are adorned with
 lettuce leaves and radishes, but are always covered
 with hot chile sauce.

 Tortillas are the national staple article of food, and
 are made of Indian corn ground on the metate, mixed
 with a little water and cooked on a flat surface over
 hot coals.


                       CHILE

 Cut open two chiles and take out all the seeds and
 thick yellow veins; put them on the back of the stove
 in cold water enough to cover them and let soak for
 two hours. Pour off this water and cover again with
 fresh water and boil fifteen minutes. Drain in a
 colander and save the water in which they were last
 boiled. When cold enough to handle, take a knife,
 scrape off all the pulp from the skin, and put in the
 water in which they were boiled and mix thoroughly.
 Fry two onions chopped fine in olive-oil to a delicate
 brown; add a teaspoonful of flour and allow that to
 brown also. Stir in the chile mixture, season with
 salt and let all thicken together.


                   COLD COLORADO

 Cook for fifteen minutes a half-pound of large
 Mexican sweet red peppers, after removing the seeds of
 all but two or three. Take off the skin, put the pulp
 through a sieve and add one and a half tablespoonfuls
 of the Mexican sausage, salt and a little of the water
 in which the peppers were boiled. Bottle tightly and
 it will keep about three weeks in a cool place.


                   MEXICAN CHILE

 Toast ten _chiles anchos_ (the dried pepper in the
 broad shape) and ten _chiles posillos_ (the dried
 pepper in the thin shape), take out the veins and
 seeds and soak them in a quart of boiling water. Pass
 through a sieve twice, getting out all the pulp, and
 fry this chile liquor in two tablespoonfuls of boiling
 lard, which has been thickened with a tablespoonful
 of browned flour. While boiling add salt, a pinch of
 Mexican sausage, a pinch of sugar, a teaspoonful of
 cider-vinegar and a tablespoonful of oil. Cook all
 together in the lard for fifteen minutes.


                    SALSA NUEZ

 Scald and peel two tomatoes; add a minced onion and
 a few pepper seeds, season with salt and stew until

 meats. Reheat and serve hot. This sauce is also used
 with fried peppers.


                      TOMATO

 Boil two pounds of tomatoes in a very little water
 and then rub them through a coarse sieve. Grind fine
 a half-pound of raisins, a quarter of a pound of
 blanched almonds, an ounce of garlic, an ounce of
 green ginger and a half-ounce of dried chiles; add
 these to the strained tomatoes with an ounce of salt,
 a half-pound of sugar and a pint of vinegar. Boil all
 together until thick.


                   HECHO EN CASA

 Take three cupfuls of sifted flour, a tablespoonful
 of lard, a level teaspoonful of salt and enough
 water to make it like pastry dough. Roll very thin
 and cut the size of a dessert plate. Have ready in a
 large frying-pan some hot lard, enough to float the
 tortillas, but not so hot as to brown them. Put in
 the tortillas, one at a time, and when they begin to
 blister they are done. This quantity will make about
 two dozen.


               TORTILLAS DE PATÁTAS

 Work a large cold boiled potato with a big
 teaspoonful of lard and a teaspoonful of salt into
 a pint of flour and add water until about the
 consistency of bread dough. Knead thoroughly and
 divide into chunks about the size of an egg and roll
 very thin. Brown very quickly on a smooth hot stove,
 turning often. When thoroughly cooked, place between a
 cloth and keep covered in this way until ready to use.


                     AMERICANO

 Cut six large red chile peppers in halves, remove
 the seeds and veins and cook in boiling water fifteen
 minutes, then press through a colander. The sauce
 should be thick and smooth. Chop the dark meat of a
 cold cooked chicken, season with salt and add two
 tablespoonfuls of the pepper pulp. Beat two eggs
 without separating, very light, and add a cupful of
 milk. Mix a half-cupful of corn-meal with a cupful
 of flour and a little salt; pour the egg and milk in
 this, making a thin batter. Put a little olive-oil
 in a frying-pan, and when boiling hot turn in enough
 batter to make a thin cake about six inches in
 diameter. Shake the pan until the mixture is set,
 then put two tablespoonfuls of the chicken mixture on
 one side of the cake, roll with a knife and remove
 to the serving-dish. When all are made pour over the
 remaining chile sauce and sprinkle the whole with
 grated Parmesan cheese.


                     DOMESTICO

 Have ready two cupfuls of cold cooked chicken cut into
 small bits, over which pour the juice of a lemon and
 sprinkle with chopped parsley. Also chop two onions
 very fine and three hard-boiled eggs; grate a pound of
 good cheese, wash a large cupful of raisins and dry
 them; have three dozen green or ripe olives handy and
 the chile sauce piping hot. Dip the tortillas in the
 hot sauce, place on a large platter and on one-half of
 it put a little of the onion, egg, chicken, cheese,
 two raisins, one olive, and lastly a spoonful of
 the chile sauce. Fold over the other half and roll
 slightly. When they are all finished, sprinkle cheese
 over all and pour over what chile sauce is left.


                      MEXICAN

 Boil eight large Mexican peppers until tender; remove
 skin and seeds and put the pulp through a sieve. Into
 two tablespoonfuls of smoking hot olive-oil put two
 sections of garlic, a teaspoonful of fine marjoram
 and salt; add the pepper-pulp and cook slowly. Chop
 two onions very fine, season with salt and pepper and
 sprinkle with a little marjoram and let stand in a
 very little vinegar. Grate a pound of Edam cheese.
 Strain the sauce and return to the stove; dip a
 tortilla in the sauce, place on a plate and spread it
 with a teaspoonful, each, of the drained onion and the
 cheese; add two olives, two large seedless raisins and
 a tablespoonful of the chile. Roll the tortilla and
 sprinkle each with onion and cheese. After all are
 made, pour over the remaining chile and garnish with
 olives.


                      NATIVO

 Buy a dozen tortillas and put on a tin in the oven to
 keep warm. Remove veins and seeds from a half-dozen
 chile peppers and boil them with a small onion and a
 clove of garlic until all are soft. Press through a
 colander, with the water in which they were boiled
 and return the sauce to the stove to keep hot. Tear
 three heads of lettuce into bits, cover with a French
 dressing and mix with it a cupful of chopped olives
 and six hard-boiled eggs, chopped. Drop each tortilla
 in hot lard for a minute, then in the sauce; place
 on a hot platter and put a big spoonful of the salad
 mixture in the center. Sprinkle generously with grated
 cheese and fold over one side, and roll. When all are
 ready pour over the remaining sauce and serve hot.


                    QUESADILLAS

 Make thin corn-meal pancakes six inches across. Dip
 one in hot chile sauce, lay on a plate and cover with
 raw onion chopped fine, grated cheese and stoned
 olives cut in half. Lay on this six other pancakes,
 each dipped in the chile sauce and covered with the
 onion, cheese and olives. Pour the remaining sauce
 over the top and set in a hot oven for a few minutes.
 Serve hot, cutting like layer-cake.


                      TAMALES

 Tamales are a mixture of meat or fowl made hot with
 chiles and wrapped in corn-husks. In preparing the
 dough or _nixtamal_, unless scalded meal is used for
 a substitute, it is necessary to prepare the shelled
 corn with lime-water. The Mexicans grind the corn
 prepared in this way, on the metate, and instead of a
 mortar use the _molcajete_ and _lejolote_.

 To prepare the corn, cover it with water, add the
 lime-water and boil until the husks slip off easily
 between the fingers, then wash in cold water until
 perfectly white. The lime-water is made by adding an
 ounce of common lime to a quart of water; stir well
 and let settle; when clear, drain off the water for
 use. One quart of lime-water prepared in this way will
 do for a pound of corn. For the wrapping, cut off the
 inside leaves of the corn-husks about an inch from
 the stalk end and boil in clear water until perfectly
 clean. Tear a few in narrow strips to use for tying
 the ends; dry the rest and rub them over with a cloth
 dipped in hot lard.


                     FARSANTA

 Use equal quantities of cold boiled chicken and veal,
 and half as much ham, all chopped. Mix together and
 moisten with good gravy. Season with salt, cayenne
 and a little chopped parsley. Make a dough by pouring
 a cupful of boiling water on a quart of fine, fresh
 corn-meal; work in a big lump of butter and add water
 until like biscuit dough. Have ready, as directed, a
 pile of the soft inner leaves or husks of green corn.
 Take a lump of dough about the size of an egg; pat it
 out flat, put a tablespoonful of the meat on it and
 roll for the inner husk. Then put on the outer husks
 with a thin piece of dough in each. Tie the ends and
 boil in water containing a few red peppers and a clove
 of garlic.


                      GENUINO

 Boil three quarts of whole corn in ash lye until the
 hulls come off; soak in clear water until the lye is
 all out, then grind. Remove the seeds and veins from
 six chile peppers, boil soft and then put through a
 colander to separate from the skin. Boil a chicken
 tender and set aside half of the well-seasoned broth;
 the rest, with the chicken, thicken with part of
 the ground corn and add the pepper-pulp and three
 tablespoonfuls of fine marjoram. For the batter, take
 the remainder of the broth and ground corn and mix
 into it a tablespoonful of olive-oil; season with salt
 and make the dough just thick enough to spread. These
 proportions will make fifteen tamales.


                     HACIENDA

 Grind two quarts of hulled corn through a
 meat-chopper and mix to a paste with two
 tablespoonfuls of melted butter, salt and cayenne.
 Divide a large, fat chicken and stew until tender, in
 water containing a clove of garlic and a pinch, each,
 of salt, comino seed and marjoram. Scald two dozen
 dry chiles, remove the seeds and veins, scrape the
 pulp from the skin, add this to the chicken-stew and
 thicken slightly with flour. Shape the corn-husks with
 scissors and soak in warm water for an hour. Remove,
 dry and rub each one with hot fat. Fill one with the
 chicken-stew, spread four others with the corn-paste;
 fold over the one containing the chicken and roll the
 others around. Tie the ends with a strip of the husk
 and steam for two hours.


                     HOT TAMAL

 For the dough, add to one pint of corn-meal, one
 tablespoonful, each, of salt and lard, and enough
 boiling water to make a thick dough. Prepare the
 corn-husks as directed. For the filling boil one pound
 of beef and pour over it hot beef fat; cut into small
 bits and season with salt and chile sauce. Put a layer
 of the dough in the husk, over this a tablespoonful of
 the prepared meat; roll like a cigarette, with a layer
 of dough between each husk. Tie each end and steam two
 hours.


               LAREDO'S CELÉBERRIMO

 Boil a pound of pork until two-thirds cooked; then
 grind it rather fine. Add a small amount of garlic,
 also a small quantity of seeded raisins and prepared
 almonds. Soak two and a half ounces of chiles in hot
 water; take out the seeds and veins, wash them well
 and grind fine, adding enough of the stock in which
 the meat was boiled to make a sauce, and strain.
 For the dough use the ground corn prepared with
 lime-water; add six ounces of fresh lard to the pound,
 salt to taste and moisten with the meat stock. Have
 the husks prepared, spread each with a thin layer of
 dough, and for the center one, a tablespoonful of the
 pork and a tablespoonful of the chile sauce. Roll
 carefully, tie the ends and steam over the liquid in
 which the meat was boiled.


                   MESA REDONDA

 Cover a four-pound chicken with hot water and add
 four onions, a clove of garlic chopped fine, a stick
 of cinnamon, ten whole allspice, ten cloves, three red
 chile peppers and a teaspoonful of salt. Simmer until
 the chicken is tender, then remove and cut into small
 pieces. Strain the liquor, put the chicken meat into
 it, add enough yellow corn-meal to make a thick mush
 and boil ten minutes. Have ready the green corn cut
 from a dozen ears and two pounds of raisins, seeded,
 and mix these into the mush, with a half-teaspoonful
 of cayenne. Fill the center husk with a piece of the
 chicken and some of the mush, roll the others around,
 each spread with a tablespoonful of the mush. Tie at
 each end and boil an hour.


                      VIAJERO

 Scald a quart of good Southern white corn-meal,
 making it moist, but not soft. Have a chicken boiled
 until tender and separated into parts; season the
 broth with the pulp of two dozen chile peppers, a
 quart of whole olives, two pounds of raisins, a cupful
 of sweet lard, salt and a suspicion of garlic; add
 enough corn-meal to thicken like gravy. Lay one of
 the prepared husks flat, put a piece of chicken on
 it and two tablespoonfuls of the thickened gravy;
 fold the husk over with the chicken inside, and roll
 around this six more husks, spreading each with two
 tablespoonfuls of the scalded meal. Tie each end
 securely with a narrow strip of the husk and steam
 three hours or longer.

                  CAFÉ CON LECHE

 Set the drip coffee-pot where it will keep hot. Put a
 cupful of ground coffee into the strainer and pour two
 tablespoonfuls of boiling water in the top; in five
 minutes, pour in a little more water, adding a little
 at a time until you have used four cupfuls, but never
 pour in water a second time until the grounds have
 ceased to bubble. In serving, fill the cup only half
