## Interface Segregation Principle

```text
Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. 
```

### Implementation notes:

* For Scala version `The Cake Pattern` is used
* For the C# version, we follow the typical scenario for DI

Both solutions are very interesting. I really like The Cake Pattern :grinning:
