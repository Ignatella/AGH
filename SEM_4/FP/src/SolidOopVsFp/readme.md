# Twins: FP and OOP

This is a small project that shows relationship between functional and object-oriented programming :monocle_face:

## How to use:

There are all 5 SOLID principles presented:

* `S` ingle Responsibility Principle
* `O` pen/Closed Principle
* `L` iskov Substitution Principle
* `I` nterface Segregation Principle
* `D` ependency Inversion Principle

For each principle there are 2 version of implementation:

1) Written in NET C# using OOP paradigm.
2) Written in Scala using FP paradigm.


#### P.S. It was very fun and informative for me to work on this project.
